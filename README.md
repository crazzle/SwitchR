## How to use SwitchR
SwitchR resides completely in the menubar. There are three commands to control the window focus:

| Shortcut                                           | Focus Action                           |
|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| ctrl - alt - n                                     | Iterate to next potential window       |
| ctrl - alt - p                                     | Iterate to previous potential window   |
| ctrl - alt - return                                | Focus potential window.                |

The potential window to focus is shown in a Popover below the menubar.
