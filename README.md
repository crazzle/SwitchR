# SwitchR

SwitchR is a window switching app that switches the focus through active windows, written in Swift.

## System Requirements
SwitchR supports macOS v11+.

## Installation
Download the app from [here](https://github.com/crazzle/SwitchR/releases/download/0.3/SwitchR.app.zip) and move it into your application folder.

## How to use SwitchR
SwitchR resides completely in the menubar. There are three commands to control the window focus:

| Shortcut                                           | Focus Action                           |
|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| ctrl - alt - n                                     | Iterate to next potential window       |
| ctrl - alt - p                                     | Iterate to previous potential window   |
| ctrl - alt - return                                | Focus potential window.                |

The potential window to focus is shown in a Popover below the menubar.
